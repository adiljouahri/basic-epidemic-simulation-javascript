# basic-epidemic-simulation-javascript
I used JavaScript library P5.js instead of python in the original repository,so more people can now use the simulation code in any browser, without installing anything.

# how to Download?

git clone https://github.com/adiljouahri/basic-epidemic-simulation-javascript.git

# Original repository 
https://github.com/najibelmokhtari/basic-epidemic-simulation
 
 # how to use?
 make sure you put the three files index.html, p5.js, sketch.js in the same folder. <br/>
 open index.html in any browser.
